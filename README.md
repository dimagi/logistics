* You might need to remove the distribute install line from the prod-requirements.txt file if you get weird pip errors

## Running Tests

Because the threadless router doesn't play nice with initiation of outbound messages in the tests you have
to make one modification to the code to get the tests to pass. Comment out the following line in
`logistics_project.apps.tanzania.reminders.send_message` so that it looks like the following:

```
def send_message(contact, message, **kwargs):
    # this hack sets the global router to threadless router.
    # should maybe be cleaned up.
    # router.router = Router()   # <---- this line commented out
    contact.message(message, **kwargs)
```
